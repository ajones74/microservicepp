== Introduction

=== MicroServices Framework

*Objectives:*
. Independently Deployable Deliverables
. Ease of Unit Testing and Black Box Testing
. Support for design variants in hardware changes -- upgrades, additions, etc.
. Support for design variants in software changes -- upgrades, bug-fixes, new features, etc.
. 

=== Pipeline Architecture

The microservice services are loosely coupled using a pipeline strategy, like so:

image:pipeline.svg[]

=== Pipeline interconnects

The interconnect between services uses NNG (Nanomesg, Next-Generation).

=== Pipeline Services URIs

. Refer to *RFC 2609*
. Also refer to *RFC 2608*, *RFC 3224* -- AKA: Service Location Protocol, or "srvloc":

.. A prototype SLP URI would look like:

----
service:mspp:logging:sink:file:file:///opt/mspp/logging/log.txt
----

----
service:mspp:logging:sink:socket:nng:localhost:5150

== An example: The GPS service.

=== The proposed service:

. The GPS device is connected to a RPi via UART/RS-232 interface.
. The GPS device has a PPS output signal -- connect it to the RPi GPIO interface.
. The GPS device is NMEA XXX compliant -- but it has PROPRIETARY messages, TOO!
- We want to FILTER away any non-standards-compliant messages -- our FIRST FILTER
- We want to FILTER away any messages that have no TIME/DATA infromation -- our SECOND FILTER.

.The (GPS SERVICE, DATA) pipeline will look something like:
----

[SRC]-->[QUEUE]-->[FRAMER]-->[Filter 1 (NMEA)]-->[Filter 2 (TIME/DATE)]--+  <1>
                                                                         |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+                                                      |
 +-->[QUEUE]-->[PUBLISH]
----
<1> SRC is UART/RS-232 interface.


.The (GPS SERVICE, PPS) pipeline will look something like:
----
[SRC]-->[Filter 1 (DEBOUNCE)]--+
[SRC]-->[
                                                                         |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+                                                      |
