== Introduction

=== MicroServices Framework

*Objectives:*
. Independently Deployable Deliverables
. Ease of Unit Testing and Black Box Testing
. Support for design variants in hardware changes -- upgrades, additions, etc.
. Support for design variants in software changes -- upgrades, bug-fixes, new features, etc.
. 

=== Pipeline Architecture

The microservice services are loosely coupled using a pipeline strategy, like so:

=== Pipeline interconnects

The interconnect between services uses NNG (Nanomesg, Next-Generation).

=== Pipeline Services URIs

. Refer to *RFC 2609*
. Also refer to *RFC 2608*, *RFC 3224* -- AKA: Service Location Protocol, or "srvloc":

.. A prototype SLP URI would look like:

----
service:mspp:logging:sink:file:file:///opt/mspp/logging/log.txt
----

----
service:mspp:logging:sink:socket:nng:localhost:5150
